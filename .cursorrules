[notes]
# - Hosted on Cloudflare (Pages/Workers)
# - Auto-deploys on every git push
# - Always auto-format code on save
# - Commit every change automatically
# - Never push dist/ to git
# - Always keep _redirects and _routes.json in sync with Cloudflare SPA best practices
# - Use Cloudflare's official SPA/static asset guidance for routing
# - Prefer autonomous, multi-step workflows without repeated confirmation
# - Think a few steps ahead and avoid unnecessary interruptions
#
# Project structure & features:
# - Component-driven architecture (React + TypeScript)
# - Custom UI primitives (Card, Table, etc.) in src/components/ui
# - Responsive, modern design with Tailwind CSS and glassmorphism
# - Weather widgets for Vietnamese cities, embeddable via iframe
# - Google Geocoding API integration for city coordinates
# - Weather data is simulated/mock but can be extended to real APIs
# - Loading and error states handled with dedicated components
# - Custom 404/NotFound page with available routes
# - Utility functions (e.g., cn) for class merging
# - Vite config with path alias (@ -> src)
# - TypeScript strictness and path aliasing in tsconfig
# - Easy to add new widgets/pages via src/pages and App.tsx
# - All business logic and API calls separated in src/services
