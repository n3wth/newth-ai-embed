# - Auto-deploys on every git push
# - Always auto-format code on save
# - Commit every change automatically
# - Never push dist/ to git
# - SPA routing and static asset handling via vercel.json
# - Prefer autonomous, multi-step workflows without repeated confirmation
# - Think a few steps ahead and avoid unnecessary interruptions
