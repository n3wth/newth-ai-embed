This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript site designed for embeddable widgets. The first page is /weather-vietnam, which displays a 10-day weather forecast for Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Ha Long Bay using the Google Weather API. Use clean, minimal, and embeddable React components. Future pages should follow this structure for easy embedding.
